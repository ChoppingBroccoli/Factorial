Takes an integer from the user then multiply all integers from 1 through n.
EXAMPLE: digit_fact(4) would be 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 and the product printed to the screen

def digit_fact(n):

    #  Assign n to next_number so we can work with it
    next_number = n


    next_number = next_number - n

    #  need a loop to determine the numbers from n - 1 and put into a list
    

    #  Print the sum to the screen
    print("the sum here")
